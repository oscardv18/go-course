# GO COURSE

I was perform this course in freecodecamp, in this course it was develop an booking application for a conference about golang

## Basics Concepts

- Print message in console: 

`fmt.Println("message")`
- All our code must belong to a package, the first statement in go file must be: 

e.g `package main`

- Variable Declaration:

`var <varName>`

e.g `var hello = "String"`

- Constants Declaration:
  
`const <constName>`

e.g `const pi = 3.14`

#### What is the variables and Constants?
The variables are used for stored values of the different types, unlike them, constants cannot change their values once they have been declared.

## How are applications organized in go?
In go is very used the package concept, it is the way in which a project organized (this is becouse is the best way for maintenance an project), go has many built-in package, such as the fmt package. This package has a very common function, this is the function for print in console.

- Print with line break:

`fmt.Println("Hello World")`

- Print with values:

```
var name = "Oscar"
fmt.Printf("Hello %v", name)
```
